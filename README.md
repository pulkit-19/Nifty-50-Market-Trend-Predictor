# Nifty-50-Market-Trend-Predictor
A Machine Learning pipeline built in Python to predict the short-term directional movement of the Nifty 50 benchmark index. This project bridges raw financial data extraction with predictive modeling, engineered specifically to identify market momentum.
## Key Achievements
* **Data Pipeline:** Automated the extraction of historical Nifty 50 index data using the `yfinance` API.
* **Feature Engineering:** Calculated and integrated key technical momentum indicators, including the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) and 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA).
* **Predictive Modeling:** Trained a Random Forest Classifier using a chronological time-series split to prevent look-ahead bias, achieving a 53.19% baseline precision.
* **Data Visualization:** Designed presentation-ready Matplotlib and Seaborn charts to interpret model feature importance and evaluate performance via a Confusion Matrix.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.10
* **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, yfinance
